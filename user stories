planning for the quote generator

I need a wrapper element of some kind with an id of quote-box
Within quote-box, I need another element that displays the quote with an id of text
There needs to be another text element of some kind which displays the author and has an id "author"
I need a button in there that says "New Quote" with an id of "new-quote"
I also need a button which redirects to twitter which says "tweet-quote"
On first load, a random quote needs to be generated and displayed right away (as well as the author)
When I click the New Quote button, a new quote is fetched and displayed on the screen in the text elements
When I click the twitter button, I am redirected to https://x.com/intent/post?hashtags=quotes&related=freecodecamp&text="Quote Here" Author Here
The wrapper must be horizontally centered
